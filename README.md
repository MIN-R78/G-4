## LLM + FAISS: PDF Vector Search Demo

This is a prototype project exploring the use of LLMs and vector databases to semantically search and summarize academic content from PDF files.

## Features

- Extract text from PDF using `PyPDF2` (no image/table processing)
- Embed full documents and queries using `bert-base-uncased`
- Store vectors in a FAISS index and support top-K similarity search
- Organized in a modular structure to support future OOP refactoring
